/*
 * GLdb thread & IOCP header file
 *
 * Relative to IOCP, epoll can be called IO before complete.
 * If system return before complete, application can get complete event,
 *   but if system return after complete, application could NOT get before it.
 * So, the unified model for application is IOCP. I do encapsulation epoll to IOCP.
 *
 * In my logic, epoll will received data order error, if multi thread epoll_wait() 
 *   same socket, whether LT or ET; but IOCP will not, if you post only one buffer for
 *   receive, while multi-thread wait complete.
 * In GLdb, IOCP system assembled by one epoll handle and one buffered eventfd. And
 *   two threads wait for each.
 * Buffered eventfd means : eventfd work on EFD_SEMAPHORE mode with an array to
 *   storage value. The array is small, for when system is busy, should tell client
 *   explicitly, instead of make system more busy.
 * In GLdbIOCP, there are a thread wait for epoll accept, read & write.
 *   and one thread wait eventfd. Each IOCP handle is another eventfd. 
 *   Application wait for it.
 * Every socket handle wait epoll, with ev.u64 for a OVERLAPPED struct, which Internal
 *   save CContextItem, and InternalHigh save WSABUF.
 *
 * for READ :
 * When epolled, epoll-thread looking for the buffer, if exist, it trigger eventfd; 
 *   if buffer is NULL, it omit it. Don't worry about lost the data, buffer is NULL
 *   means application is not ready. When the application ready, it will PostReceive
 *   a buffer by WSARecv() (I use this function name in Linux too), which trigger
 *   eventfd.
 * When eventfded, eventfd-thread always read socket, whether by epoll or application.
 *   if EAGAIN, continue wait; or trigger IOCP handle with CContextItem and buffer 
 *   pointer as the return value of IOCP for complete read. And of course, empty
 *   the buffer for this socket.
 *
 * for WRITE :
 * Application WSASend() only trigger eventfd thread. eventfd thread write socket, 
 *   if OK, eventfd thread trigger IOCP for write complete; if EAGAIN, add EPOLLOUT
 *   to epoll, write more when epolled till OK. Then remove EPOLLOUT and trigger
 *   IOCP for complete write.
 *
 * Of course, epoll work on ET, efficiency always the first goal for GLdb.
 *
 * GLdb is a Multi-thread customed Key-Value No-SQL memory database.
 * GLdb atomic insert voucher & update balance, provide interface for ERP.
 * GLdb have its own Async IO system, support Windows & Linux by IOCP & epoll.
 * GLdb request large memory, so only support 64bit system.

 * GLdbIOCP has only one instance
 *
 * class CLdbIOCP alloc IOCP handle, and clone two thread.
 * Its behavior following the define in RThread.
 *
 * The program use this class should call InitGldbIOCP() at first, and call
 *   FreeGLdbIOCP() at last.
 * GetIOCPItem() is used by CreateIoCompletionPort(), should not be called directly.
 *
 * iocpHandle    : Application wait this as IOCP handle.
 *                 GLdb always use static memory, 63 is enough for any application
 * iocpHandleFree: list the unused IOCP handle.
 * iocpHandleUsed: list for used IOCP handle, only used when program exit.
 * threadEpoll   : RThreadEpoll class
 * threaEvent    : RThreadEvent class
